## What is an AI Engineer?

An AI Engineer uses pre-trained models and existing AI tools to improve user experiences. They focus on applying AI in practical ways, without building models from scratch. This is different from AI Researchers and ML Engineers, who focus more on creating new models or developing AI theory.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Is AI engineer a good career choice?

Yes, becoming an AI engineer is a great career choice. AI is transforming nearly every industry, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. As companies increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, the demand for skilled AI engineers continues to grow. This role offers opportunities to work on cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, making it a highly innovative field

What is reinforcement learning?

[Reinforcement learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-101-e24b50e1d292) (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike traditional supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled data. Instead, the agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time, it aims to maximize cumulative rewards by refining its strategy based on past experiences. RL is often used in areas like robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems, where the goal is to develop intelligent behaviors through trial and error.

Do AI Engineers need a degree?

While a degree in computer science, data science, or a related field can provide a solid foundation for becoming an AI engineer, it is not strictly necessary. Many successful AI engineers are self-taught or have gained expertise through online courses, certifications, and hands-on projects.
